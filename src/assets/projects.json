The objective of this solution is to adapt customers workflows. Since business and confidentiality constraints are strict in pharma, the solution must be able to be deployed locally with total independence between the different data sets. In addition, the processing time must remain lower than the data acquisition time in order to guarantee an optimal user experience.",

Each operation on the data is automatically recorded, guaranteeing the reproducibility of the results. The analysis tools are packaged via Conda and Docker and are automatically installed on demand when the user launches a tool. The graphical interface allows scientists to interactively analyze data and visualize the results BioImageIT integrates a plugin system to use external backends such as OMERO for example. The use of BioImageIT has allowed applied mathematics research teams to transfer tools (python, c++) previously not compatible with the biologists' environment (mainly Java), without the need to re-develop a graphical interface for each tool.",

This project resulted in the Melasma Automatic Detector tool allowing automated analysis of clinical studies of skin treatments from multispectral images. Each patient is followed throughout the study and the tool generates a severity score for each visit. A statistical analysis on all patients then allows conclusions to be drawn as to the effectiveness of the treatment. This tool allows the duration of a pre-clinical study to be divided by 3.",
